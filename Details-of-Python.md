# History of Python

Python was implemented in late 1989. The language was invented to be a language capable of exception handling and to interact with the Amoeba operation system. In 2000, the Python 2.0 was introduced to include a cycle-detecting garbage collector, support for Unicode, and for a shift to a community-based development process.

The language was created to replace the language ABC. It has become popular on its own though due its easability in reading, object-orientation, structured programming, functional programming, and ability to be used as a scripting language.

# Unique Features of Python
While the Python language has evolved over the years by taking in aspects of other languages, it does have a few specific features. First, Python explicitly passes self as a form of a parameter to object member functions. The language also combines things such as data entry - prompting the user for entry and reading it in - to a simple function called 'input()'. Finally, the language incorporates a large number of datatypes such as ordereddict, namedtupke, array, list, tuple, diction, etc; making it popular in the scientific community.
