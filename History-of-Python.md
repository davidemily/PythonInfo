#History of Python

Python was implemented in late 1989. The language was invented to be a language capable of exception handling and to interact with the Amoeba operation system. In 2000, the Python 2.0 was introduced to include a cycle-detecting garbage collector, support for Unicode, and for a shift to a community-based development process.

The language was created to replace the language ABC. It has become popular on its own though due its easability in reading, object-orientation, structured programming, functional programming, and ability to be used as a scripting language.
